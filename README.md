ISO8601 Duration Parser for Golang

Provides a partial implementation of ISO8601 durations. Parsing doesn't take into consideration variable lengths
of days (24~25), months (28~31) nor years (365~366). It will default to the following:

* 1 Day = 24 Hours
* 1 Month = 30 Days
* 1 Year = 365 Days

Also, converting back to string will omit months and work with days and weeks.

e.g.

```
INPUT     OUTPUT
P1M       P30D
P1M5D     P5W
P1Y1M5D   P1Y35D
```
